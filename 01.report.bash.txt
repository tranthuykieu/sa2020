1. List everyone logged in and save the list in the file called "users" in your own home directory:

w > ~/users

2. List all process that are running and add this list to the end of "users" file:

ps -a >> ~/users

3. List everyone who is logged on sorted by their username

w | sort

4. Count number of session each logged in user, sorted by this number in descending order

who | cut -d " " f1 | sort -n | uniq -c

5. Show content of the first and last 3 lines of the file '/etc/fstab'

// my folder /etc has 2 files fstab: fstab.hd and fstab.hd~previous
// I cannot open any of them
// but maybe the solution is:

head -3 /etc/fstab.hd; tail -3 /etc/fstab.hd

// need .hd if not, there are the notices:
//  + head: /etc/fstab: No such file or directory
//  + tail: /etc/fstab: No such file or directory

6. Retrieve line number 5 to 10 from the file “/etc/fstab” and write these lines into a new file “extract.txt”

sed -n -e '5,10p' fstab.hd > extract.txt

7. List all files in current directory, recursively, to which the user has full permissions:

ls -lRa | grep "^-rwx"

8. Compare two files and show percentage of similarities between them:

./compare.sh a.txt b.txt

// in compare.sh file:

#!/bin/bash 
diffLines=`diff $1 $2 | egrep "^(>|<)" | wc -l`
aLines=`wc -l < $1`
bLines=`wc -l < $2`
echo $aLines
echo $bLines
diffPer=`echo "$diffLines * 100 * 2 / ($aLines + $bLines)" | bc`
echo $diffPer
similar=`echo "100-$diffPer" | bc`

echo Similariry $similar


9. Find all files in current directory, recursively, that are at least 90% similar:

list=`find .`
for f1 in $list; do
	for f2 in list; do
		if [ "$f1" != "$f2" ] && [ -f "$f1" ] && [ -f "$f2" ]; then
			diffLines=`diff $1 $2 | egrep "^(>|<)" | wc -l`
			aLines=`wc -l < $1`
			bLines=`wc -l < $2`	
			if [ $aLines -eq 0 ] && [ $bLines -eq 0 ]; then
				exit 0
			fi

			diffPer=`echo "$diffLines * 100 * 2 / ($aLines + $bLines)" | bc`
			similar=`echo "100-$diffPer" | bc`

			if [ "$similar" -gt 90 ]; then
				echo Similarity $similar: $1 $2
			fi
		fi
	done
done
