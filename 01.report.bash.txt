1. List everyone logged in and save the list in the file called "users" in your own home directory:

w > ~/users

2. List all process that are running and add this list to the end of "users" file:

ps -a >> ~/users

3. List everyone who is logged on sorted by their username

w | sort

4. Count number of session each logged in user, sorted by this number in descending order

w | sort -r

5. Show content of the first and last 3 lines of the file '/etc/fstab'

// my folder /etc has 2 file fstab: fstab.hd and fstab.hd~previous
// I cannot open any of them
// but maybe the solution is:

head -3 /etc/fstab.hd; tail -3 /etc/fstab.hd

// need .hd if not, there is a notice 
//  + head: /etc/fstab: No such file or directory
//  + tail: /etc/fstab: No such file or directory

6. Retrieve line number 5 to 10 from the file “/etc/fstab” and write these lines into a new file “extract.txt”

sed -n -e '3,5p' fstab.hd > extract.txt

7. List all files in current directory, recursively, to which the user has full permissions:



8. Compare two files and show percentage of similarities between them:



9. Find all files in current directory, recursively, that are at least 90% similar:
